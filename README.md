# 🧠 Emotion Detection from Text (WIP)

A machine learning project that aims to detect and classify emotions in textual data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to build a model that can understand and label emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and more from raw text inputs.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- ✅ Clean and preprocess textual data  
- ✅ Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- 🔄 Train and evaluate ML models  
- 🚧 Build a Flask-based web interface (in progress)  
- ⏳ Deploy the application using Streamlit or Render (planned)

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Frameworks:** Flask *(for deployment)*  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

Project structure will be added soon as development progresses.

## 📊 Dataset

This project explores and compares three public datasets for emotion classification from text. Each dataset offers a different emotion labeling scheme and data format, helping us evaluate the model’s generalizability.

1. **Emotion Detection from Text (Kaggle - Pashupati Gupta)**  
   - **Source:** [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pashupatigupta/emotion-detection-from-text)  
   - **Description:** Short texts labeled with emotions like happy, sad, anger, and surprise.

2. **Emotion Dataset (Kaggle - Parul Pandey)**  
   - **Source:** [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/emotion-dataset)  
   - **Description:** Clean, labeled dataset with six basic emotions (joy, anger, sadness, etc.) from user-generated text.

3. **GoEmotions Dataset (Google via TensorFlow Datasets)**  
   - **Source:** [TensorFlow Link](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/goemotions)  
   - **Description:** A large-scale dataset with 58 emotion labels based on Reddit comments. Useful for fine-grained emotion analysis.
